# Linear Regression Prediction Model

# Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a linear regression model developed during my internship at The Spart Foundation. The model is designed for making predictions based on a given dataset using linear regression techniques.

# Introduction
The linear regression prediction model is a machine learning model that aims to predict a target variable based on one or more independent variables. In this project, we use the linear regression algorithm to create a predictive model to predict the percentage of a student score based on the number of study hours.

# Model Training
The model training process is documented in the Jupyter notebook (Prediction using Supervised ML (LinearRegression)). This notebook contains the code and explanations for loading the dataset, preprocessing, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

# Results
After training the model, the results, including performance metrics and visualizations, are presented in the Jupyter notebook. Feel free to explore the notebook to gain insights into the model's predictions.
